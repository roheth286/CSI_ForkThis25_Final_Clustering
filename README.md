# Clustering of Sensorless Drive Diagnosis ⚙️📊

## Description 📝

This dataset comprises features derived from motor current signals. The motor operates under **11 distinct conditions** representing combinations of intact and defective components. Each condition is measured across **12 different operating scenarios**, varying in speed, load moments, and load forces. The current signals were captured using a probe and oscilloscope on **two phases**. The dataset does not explicitly indicate which conditions are defective or intact. 

To investigate the underlying structure and patterns within the data, **clustering algorithms** are applied. Using unsupervised techniques, we aim to uncover natural groupings of motor conditions, potentially distinguishing defective from intact components, and understand how different operating setups affect the recorded signal features.

The dataset consists of **58,509 examples**, each with **48 features**. The last column contains labels indicating the class to which each sample belongs.
